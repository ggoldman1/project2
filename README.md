# BFS Description
BFS is a search algorithm that moves layer-by-layer through a graph. It does this by storing outgoing neighbors in a queue. This means that the children of a current node will be visited **after** the other nodes in the layer of the current node. This implies that BFS will always find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
